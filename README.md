### navigating the page
To launch the page, the user needs to run the main.py file by downloading and opening the repository into a code editor.  Once the main.py file is running, the user should be able to navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ on their brower to view the visulzations.
The only customizable part of the Dash page is the dropdown menu that contains all of the countries within the report.  These countries can be selected and deselected as the user wants.
