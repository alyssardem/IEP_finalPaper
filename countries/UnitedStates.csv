1,1,1.1,4.6875,"The above policies are addressed through federal legislation. As the United States operates as afederalist system, this does not include state legislation that may be more specific. Regulation ofwetlands, in general, is administered through fivefederal agencies: the Department of Interior,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; the Department ofCommerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the Department of Agriculture,Natural Resources Conservation Service; and the Department of Defense, U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers.One of the overarching pieces of legislation addressing the above elements is the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). NEPA linked the critical importance of restoring andmaintaining environmental quality with overall welfare, declaring that it is the continuing policyof the Federal Government, in cooperation with State and local governments and otherconcerned public and private organizations, to useall practicable means and measures to fosterand promote the general welfare, creating and maintaining conditions under which humans andnature can exist in productive harmony. NEPA acknowledged the responsibility of the FederalGovernment to use all practical means to improve and coordinate federal plans, functions,programs, and resources in order that the Nation may fulfill its responsibilities as trustee of theenvironment for succeeding generations. More specifically, NEPA requires every federal agencyto examine the environmental impacts of proposed major federal actions and to considerreasonable alternatives and cumulative impacts, sharing its analysis with the public forcomment, before deciding on action. Because the substantive statute pursuant to which anagency is undertaking a particular action may provide broad discretionary power to agencydecision making, NEPA’s “procedural” requirements are often the principal, and in some casesthe most powerful tool available to citizens for challenging agency action in the courts. NEPAalso established a national policy for the environment and established the Council onEnvironmental Quality (CEQ). The Chair of CEQ serves as the President’s principal environmentalpolicy advisor. CEQ oversees Federal agencies' implementation of NEPA through regulationsimplementing the procedural provisions of the act and through interpretation of statutoryrequirements.https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-national-environmental-policy-actThe Federal Government regulates, through Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, some of theactivities that occur in wetlands. The Section 404program originated in 1972, when Congresssubstantially amended the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and created a Federal regulatoryplan to control the discharge of dredged or fill materials into wetlands and other waters of theUnited States. Discharges are commonly associatedwith projects such as channel constructionand maintenance, port development, fills to createdry land for development sites near thewater, and water-control projects such as dams andlevees. Other kinds of activities, such as thestraightening of river channels to speed the flow of water downstream and clearing land, areregulated as Section 404 discharges if they involvedischarges of more than incidental amountsof soil or other materials into wetlands or other waters.https://www.epa.gov/cwa-404/overview-clean-water-act-section-404Illustrative examples of additional relevant legislation:Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (aka the Farm Bill) –https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ334/PLAW-115publ334.pdfCoastal Zone Management Act –https://coast.noaa.gov/czm/act/",United States

5,1,2.4,3,"While the management of water varies state to stateand even tribe to tribe throughout theUnited States, there are a number of examples on federally managed lands where themanagement of water is applied to decision-making processes for ecological restorationprograms.One such illustrative example comes from the Wetland State-and-Transition ModelProject (https://ecos.fws.gov/ServCat/Reference/Profile/54956):This project is designed to understand resources indifferent wetland states through watermanagement and monitoring of resource responses. The project is being implemented atsemi-permanently flooded wetland habitats throughout the Intermountain West andwestern Prairie Pothole regions that provide important resources for migrating andbreeding migratory birds and other wetland-dependent wildlife. Project sites includingsome of the largest wetland complexes as National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) (e.g.,Benton Lake, Malheur, and Red Rock Lakes NWRs) andstate Wildlife ManagementAreas (WMAs) (e.g., Farmington Bay, Freezeout Lake,and Market Lake WMAs).Wetland management actions often mimic natural disturbance processes in order tomaintain ecological function in modified systems.Objectives for semi-permanentlyflooded wetland habitats within these regions typically focus on one of the two followingapproaches to management: 1) managing for wetland function to provide a desired plantcommunity, or 2) managing to provide habitat for aspecified population size and/or life-history requirement(s) of focal wildlife species.For example, sago pondweed (Stuckeniapectinata), a pioneering wetland plant species, ismore nutritious and often morepreferred by herbivorous migratory birds than species more tolerant of anoxic conditionssuch as shortspike watermilfoil (Myriophyllum sibiricum). Hence, managementobjectives for semi-permanently flooded wetlands often include maintaining a relativelyhigh abundance of sago pondweed for the benefit ofmigratory birds.The primary disturbance process of management interest in semi-permanently floodedwetland habitats is the dynamic wet/dry hydrological cycle, which is a key driver ofwetland productivity and vegetation community structure. Water level changes (eithermanaged or natural) are perturbations that influence nutrient turnover rates, vegetation,aquatic invertebrates, and resource availability for wetland-dependent wildlife. Thefrequency, timing, and duration of drawdowns (natural or managed) are important factorsin determining which vegetation community phases are expressed within a semi-permanently flooded wetland area. The ability to predict the response of vegetation towater level changes varies depending on the knowledge of the wetland system beingmanaged and life history characteristics of plants.The first component of this project isto build a common management framework for semi-permanently flooded wetlandhabitats across the three regions. The framework will incorporate ecological processes,and site and management potentials, to define a range of states and vegetationcommunity phases within states.This project was started in 2013 and is ongoing. Results are being used to fine-tunewetland management and Inventory and Monitoring Plans to verify local aquatic stateand transition models and water control schedules to optimize water bird numbers orwildlife diversity depending on a site’s managementobjectives and conservation goals.Results can be found at the ServCat link provided above for annual reports produced in2014-2019.",United States

50,3,12.2,5,"One illustrative example of effective implementation of wetland restoration/rehabilitation programs is the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA), which conserves North America’s waterfowl, fish and wildlife resources while producing a variety of environmental and economic benefits. Its success is driven by partnerships involving federal, state and local governments; nonprofit organizations such as Ducks Unlimited; and community groups. Every federal dollar provided by NAWCA must be matched by at least one dollar from nonfederal sources. Because the program is so effective, NAWCA funds are usually tripled or quadrupled on the local level. Most recently, NAWCA has granted $1.83 billion in federal funding for projects – a figure that has leveraged an additional $3.75 billion from matching and nonmatching funds. Since its inception, more than 3,000 NAWCA projects have contributed to the conservation of almost 30 million acres of habitat across North America",United States

These are: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (known as the Clean Water Act, CWA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the Rivers and Harbors Act, and the Agriculture Improvements Act of 2018 (Farm Bill). These laws have resulted in the regulation of activities undertaken in areas designated as wetlands; acquisition of wetlands through purchase or protective easements that prevent certain activities, such as draining and filling; restoration of damaged wetlands or the creation of new wetlands; and disincentives to altering wetlands or incentives to protect them in their natural states",United States
