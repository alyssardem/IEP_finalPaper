This is a joint initiative between the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Department of Human Settlement, Water and Sanitation and the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development. The South African government created and operationalized the Expended Public Works Programme. Under this programme there are a number of sub-programmes that focus on labour intensive restoration, rehabilitation and management of natural resources including wetland ecosystems. A specific sub-programme titled ‘Working for Wetlands’, has been operational since 2000. The programme focuses on restoration, protection and wise use of wetlands whilst at the same time providing employment creation, skills transfer and enterprise development especially for disadvantaged youth and women.",South Africa
2,1,2.1,5,"The Ecological Water Requirements (EWRs) that wetlands require to enable them, as a natural water resource, to support their ecological infrastructure (ecosystem services) are addressed in terms of Section 14 to 17 in the National Water Act (Act 36 of 1998). The first EWRs to be determined by the Department of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation, date back to the early 1990’s, during the method development process. Since then a large number of EWRs have been assessed. The water requirement to support in-stream and riparian habitats are taken into account and rated based on the hydro geomorphic type, their position in the landscape, the functional importance of the wetland and its sensitivity to changes. The importance of a wetland is influenced by one or more factors: its status as being a Ramsar wetland, or if wetlands are in a conservation area, or if the wetlands are functioning as a complex of wetlands all contributing to biodiversity, or if the wetlands are a threatened type (like peat wetlands) and/or the wetland supporting hydrological functioning of the surface water or groundwater surrounding the wetland or downstream. These EWRs are determined through scientifically validated methods and assessments are conducted by a team of accredited experts. Methods exist for determining the water allocations from surface and groundwater to sustain rivers, estuaries and wetlands. The results are produced (pending on the type of wetland) either as the water quantity and quality required, with other ecological specifications (conditions for management) or in the case of seeps and pans, ecological conditions are set that addresses the contribution of these wetlands as a wetland type and as their importance in the hydrological landscape. The results are published in the South African government gazette and are legally enforceable. Resource Directed Measures: Measures for water resources, including wetlands, consisting of the determination of Environmental Flow Requirements (EFR) for both quality and quantity), determining the management class for significant water resources and setting Resource Quality Objectives. South Africa’s National Wetland Monitoring Programme led by DWS. is in the process of being set up, SANBI will support this programme through continued improvement of the status of data on the condition of wetlands to be reported in the National Wetland Map annual version updates. SANBI’s Freshwater Biodiversity Unit is engaged in several projects with a focus in improving understanding of wetland hydrology and water quality across the country’s wetlands including: GEF 5 Ecological Infrastructure for Water Security Water Resource Accounts component for multiple catchments with University of KZN; a wetland-catchment research collaboration for multiple wetlands and catchments with University of the Free State; an MOU with The Nature Conservancy on a freshwater biodiversity monitoring protocols, including wetland hydrology monitoring, in several regions where TNC are supporting setting up Water Funds; a field-based pilot project on monitoring priority wetlands for the Western Cape province in collaboration with mutliple partners (includes wetland water quality monitoring and detailed wetland water level monitoring); collaboration with the University of Stellenbosch and Rhodes University on NRFfunded research on the Resilience of regulatory ecosystem services in wetlands: factors impacting upon sediment trapping, phosphate assimilation and toxicant removal (6 students and 3 senior researchers); as well as 2 independent MSc research projects on wetland-agriculture interactions.

3,1,2.2,5,"Chapter 3 of the NWA (Act 36 of 1998) outlines a set of three measures to protect water resources, namely the Class, Resource Quality Objectives (RQOs) and the Reserve (EWRs). The RQOs provide a set of specifications for the management requirements to meet a specific Target Ecological Category (TEC) for a particular wetland and it also provides the ecological requirements that need to be implemented before additional development can take place, or the ecological specification required to bring the wetland to the TEC if it is not in that category already in its present state. The Minister of the Department of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation, the DirectorGeneral, an organ of state and the water management institutions, must give effect to any determination of the class of a water resource, the RQOs and the Reserve when exercising any power or performing any duty in terms of the National Water Act (Act 36 of 1998). This includes issuing of water use authorizations where the environmental flow is set as the first requirement to be met before new authorizations for use can be approved. National wetland programs such as Working for Wetlands uses the gazetted environmental flows and RQOs as a target to work towards when implementing mitigation and rehabilitation measures.",South Africa
4,1,2.3,5,"Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) is implemented as best practice in South Africa. Policies and implementation of IWRM, applying an ecosystem-based approach, are included in water resource planning activities on a national, provincial and local government level as well as cross boundary in the other SADC counties. At a water resource systems level water resource plans (known as reconciliation strategies) aim to reconcile future water demands with supply and take account of EWRs when determining future interventions. Similarly, water quality management plans such as those determined for the Vaal and more recently, the Olifants River Basins, take account of the water quality requirements of ecosystems when determining source and resource based water quality interventions. Where towns are highly dependent on groundwater, Aquifer Management Plans are developed which take account of the groundwater contributions to wetlands. These plans are of particular importance in informing decisions concerning groundwater management, catchment/river basin management, and land to sea management. Sustainable water use is thus addressed from a strategic level/holistic picture related to activities in the catchment and how those activities ultimately effect a particular wetland/s on a more localized scale. How has the cumulative impacts related to water and land use changed the wetland from its natural state to its present state. This information will indicate what actions are required to be implemented to manage the wetland/s to achieve its sustainable state. The provision of ecological water requirements and basic human needs (where people are directly dependent on the water resource/wetland for their subsistence use) is the only right to water in the NWA and should be determined before any water use could be considered of authorized.",South Africa

The USAID’s RESILIM-O focusses on the Olifants catchment. The program aims to reduce the vulnerability of people and ecosystems in the Olifants Catchment specifically, by improving how transboundary natural resources are managed. By understanding the systemic causes of vulnerability, including climate vulnerability, it is promoting new ways of thinking and acting to promote integrated water and biodiversity management. As part of the RESLIM-O initiative real time monitoring systems have been implemented on a number of gauging stations on the Olifants River and in particular on those in close proximaty to the Kruger National Park. This system has been developed by AWARD and measures daily flows in order to assess whether the Ecological Water Requirements are being met and to expedite corrective action where applicable.",South Africa

Exact numbers of wastewater reuse systems and volumes reused is currently unknown, although there are some local success stories. The community of Beaufort West in the Karoo region, for instance, blends approximately 20 percent reused water into its water supply from local dams. The Durban Water Reclamation Plant treats 47.5Ml of domestic and industrial wastewater to a near potable standard for sale to industrial customers for direct use in their processes. In a number of systems domestic wastewater is reused for the purpose of irrigating pastures. Water reuse is expected to grow in future as South African strategies call for improved water use efficiency.",South Africa
10,1,2.14,5,"The direct discharge of water containing waste into wetlands, including estuaries and the marine environment does take place but is strictly regulated through South African legislation to ensure that discharged wastewater meets certain standards to protect human health and ecosystem requirements and to ensure that water is fit-for-use for downstream users. The discharge of effluent into an estuary must be authorized by the Department of Environmental Affairs in terms of National Environmental Management Act (Act 107 of 1998): Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations. Discharge of water containing waste into a water resource is regulated through the National Water Act, Act 36 of 1998. Wetlands are normally used to polish final effluent rather than used as a primary treatment. The discharge of untreated wastewater directly into natural wetland systems is not considered best practice in South Africa",South Africa
11,1,3.1,5,"The private sector mostly engages on wetland related issues through applications for the authorisation of developments that affect wetlands in terms of the National Water Act, Act 36 of 1998 and the National Environmental Management Act, Act 107 of 1998. As part of such applications a number of guidelines are applied. South African legislation and wetland guidelines are in keeping with the Ramsar wise use guidelines. South Africa has a number of platforms where business is engaged in water related issues this includes the Business and Biodiversity Network, driven by a non-governmental organisation, called the Endangered Wildlife Trust. The National Biodiversity and Business Network (NBBN) recognises the importance of biodiversity to business and builds the capacity of business to act as a positive force for the conservation of biodiversity in South Africa Large pulp and paper industries and well as Sugar Cane industries have many wetlands within their plantations and are encouraged to delineate buffer zones and remove sugar cane and the plantation trees from wetland areas. These industries are often involved in various awareness campaigns to inform the surrounding communities. A number of NGOs also have awareness campaigns targeted at the public and private sector on the wise use of wetlands and the benefits for property owners to maintain the functionality of the wetlands, the legislation protecting wetlands i.e. the demarcated buffer zone required before development can occur. Programs such as working for water and wetlands not only provide job opportunities but it also provides training to the local communities on the wise use of wetlands. Schools and the youth are made aware of resources through programs such as mini SASS (monitoring of the health of rivers based on aquatic indicators reacting on their habitat which is an indicator of water resource health). Water week also focus on programs such as adopt a river by including the private sector/communities to take responsibility for a stretch of water resource to clean.",South Africa

Developers, including high impact developers such as forestry , mining , local government and agriculture, attempt to implement best practice, since best practices could be advantagious to improved tourism, prevent increased costs in water purification, prevent flooding in town planning zoned areas etc. Thus the incentatives are indirect in terms of the ecological infrastructure that intact wetlands provide. Awareness capaigns addressing the benefits and the incentives that can be obtained by healty functioning wetlands need to be amplified. South Afrcia is currently engaged in studies related to the payment for ecological services (PES’s) as a potential charge to be reserved as part of the water tarrifs in catchments.

15,1,4.1,5,"Yes, South Africa has such an inventory. The Alien and Invasive Species Regulations of 2014 (as amended) have specifically listed several species for control or eradication on inland and offshore islands. The country also has the Baseline data document for alien and invasive species monitoring (published in 2018), that indicated a total of 57 species that are known to occur in at least 8 Ramsar sites in South Africa. The highest number of A&IS are found in Wilderness (14 species), followed by Makuleke, Langebaan lagoon, and Barberspan nature reserve with 10 species each. A total of 40 species identified on those 8 Ramsar sites are listed in terms of AIS NEMBA Regulations as amended in 2016 and 2017 are not yet listed. Of the common top 10 AIS that are found in the Ramsar sites, Azolla spp. (Azolla filiculoides) is found in three Ramsar sites. At least eight are commonly found in not more than two Ramsar sites. In addition, we have some specific examples that show that several invasive plants species invading the wetlands in South Africa have been listed as requiring control (category 1b), with some having been identified as potential targets for eradication (category 1a) at the islands managed by South Africa (for example Bent Grass [Agrostis castellana] on Prince Edward Island). In addition, five mammal and one bird species have been listed as requiring control specifically on islands. These include three species of rats (genus Rattus), the house mouse Mus musculus, the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus and the Chukar partridge [Alectoris chukar]. Two mammal species (the goat [Capra hircus] and the domestic cat [Felis catus]) have also been listed as potential eradication targets.",South Africa
16,1,4.2,5,"Section 75 (4) of NEM:BA requires that the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries ensures the coordination and implementation of programmes for the prevention, control or eradication of invasive species. The Act also empowers [section 75 (5)] the Minister to establish an entity consisting of public servants to coordinate and implement programmes for the prevention, control or eradication of invasive species. The A&IS Regulations, published in 2014 under the NEM:BA state further (in Chapter 2) that “if an Invasive Species Management Programme has been developed in terms of section 75(4) of the Act, a person must control the listed invasive species in accordance with such programme”. In this regard, the management authorities of protected areas, and all other organs of state in all spheres of government are required to prepare area management plans (termed “Invasive Species Monitoring, Control and Eradication Plans” in the regulations), and to submit those plans to the Minister of Environment. The guidelines for control plans set out the requirements for adequate planning, and plans were required to include the following: • A detailed list and description of any listed invasive species occurring on the relevant land. • A description of the part of land that is infested with such listed invasive species. • An assessment of the extent of such infestation. • A review of the efficacy of previous control and eradication measures. • A description of the measures to monitor, control and eradicate the listed invasive species. • Measurable indicators of progress and success, and indications of when the control plan is to be completed. In addition, the management actions of invasive species, are supported by awareness interventions which are deployed to raise public awareness on the vital role of wetlands for people and our planet, and also to highlight the importance of effective management of invasive species infesting our wetlands. Such awareness activities gather much needed feedback from the stakeholders on what can be done and provide platform for the exchange of information on the challenges of biological invasions in our water resources",South Africa
17,1,4.3,5,"The Working for Water Programme (WfWater) established in 1995 is the South Africa’s largest funder of invasive species control measures. Its original purpose was to implement invasive plant control operations to reduce their impacts on water resources, and to create much-needed employment amongst the rural poor. This programme has been subsequently renamed to a suite of programmes which include the Working for Wetlands programme which also provide considerable support to management of Ramsar sites where rehabilitation or control of AIS is problematic. In addition, SA is in the process of adopting a national strategy for managing biological invasions as the next step to ensure that the work of all role-players is integrated and that all projects are working towards national objectives thus include control and management actions in wetlands ecosystem. A typical example on the successful control and management of invasive species is the one on the Domestic Cat that has been successfully eradicated from the Prince Edwards Islands in SA. In the next coming years South Africa will be embarking on a process of eradicating the House Mouse in the same islands. It is worth noting that it has been estimated that about 5% of the Prince Edward Islands (PEIs), which is also a Ramsar site of high conservation value, is covered by invasive plants, which have established around the coastal periphery on both Marion and Prince Edward Islands, and they are spreading across the inland. Studies on the impacts thereof have primarily focussed on the effects of vertebrate invaders, of which the house mouse, which is restricted to Marion Island, is the invasive species which probably has the greatest impact on the indigenous biota of the islands. Because of the risk of alien introductions, strict biosecurity regulations govern activities at the PEIs. These are particularly aimed at reducing the rates of introduction of new alien species. In addition, some effort is currently being made to eradicate selected rangerestricted species",South Africa

Water resources related to these areas are assigned a high level of protection not just from an ecological perspective but also from a socio economic importance. The inclusion of wetlands as importance ecological infrastructure in basin scale strategies and plans is a growing field in South Africa. This field currently encompasses continuing research on wetlands and the benefits they provide by the South African Water Research Commission, the continued development of more accurate datasets, and case studies to illustrate the approaches that can be followed to integrate wetlands into River Basin Management.
