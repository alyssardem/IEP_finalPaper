EU candidate countries in the process of harmonization must translate the SEA Directive into national laws. In the course of adjusting European policies, in 2005, Montenegro adopted the Law on Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment (“OG of Montenegro” 80/05, and “OG of Montenegro” 59/11 and 52/16) (the SEA Law), which began on 1 January 2008. Since 2011, the amended version of the Act has been amended, which is fully aligned with the SEA Directive. The law is implemented both at the state and at the local levels. At national level, this law is the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency; while at local level this is the responsibility of local self-government units. The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for issuing or denying the approval for the Report on Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment, while other ministries are competent for the implementation of the Strategic Environmental Impact Assessment.
