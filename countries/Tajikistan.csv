2,1,2.1,5,"The Republic of Tajikistan is the center of the formation of water resources in Central Asia. In Tajikistan, the river flow formation zone accounts for 90% of its territory. Glaciers, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and underground waters form the basis of the water resources of the Republic of Tajikistan. In general, the average annual flow of rivers formed in Tajikistan is 64 km^3 / year, including 62.9 km^3 / year in the Amu Darya River basin and 1.1 km^3/year in the Syr Darya River basin. The rivers of Tajikistan form 55.4% of the average annual surface runoff of the Aral Sea basin. The average annual precipitation in Tajikistan is about 760 mm, varying from 100 mm in some parts of the south of the country to 2400 mm in the high mountains of the Pamirs. Climate change affects the state of water resources and every year natural disasters associated with climate change cause great damage to the country's economy. The runoff formation zone in Tajikistan is 90% of its territory. The melting of glaciers forms up to 25% of all water resources and they make up a significant part of the summer base flow, and in particularly dry years up to 50 %. During the flood period on all rivers passes from 70 to 90% of the annual flow. In general, the average annual flow of rivers formed in Tajikistan is 64 km3 / year, including 62.9 km3 in the Amu Darya basin and 1.1 km3 in the Syr Darya basin. Tajikistan's rivers provide 55.4% of the average annual surface runoff of the Aral Sea basin.",Tajikistan
